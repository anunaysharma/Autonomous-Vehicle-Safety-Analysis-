# Autonomous Vehicle Safety Analysis

Autonomous Vehicles are complex systems that use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to integrate mechanical, electronic and computing technologies to make real-time driving decisions. Several states in the USA (e.g. California, Texas, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Florida) and other parts of the world (e.g. China) have already started field-testing AVs on public roads. As AVs have started interacting more directly with humans on public roads, the safety and resilience of AVs is a significant concern (Uber’s fatal accident, Tesla’s autopilot flaw) and must be thoroughly evaluated through analysis of data obtained during field-testing.
The California DMV mandates that all manufacturers testing AVs on public roads file annual reports detailing disengagements and accidents. A disengagement occurs when a failure in the AV system causes control of the vehicle to switch from software to the human driver.

This project was focussed on the study of disengagement data from AV manufactures and analyze the current state of AV safety.

All the analaysis results and findings are compiled in Final_Presentation.pdf
